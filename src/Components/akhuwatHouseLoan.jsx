            <li>On the other hand, normal home loans need collateral like land or valuable things, but Asaan Qarz's home loans don't need any security. This means that anyone can use it, even if they don't own land or valuable things.</li>

            <li>Asaan Qarz also works to include everyone in the financial system by giving these housing loans to underserved and low-income areas. This gives families the chance to own their own houses, become financially stable, and live in a safer and more respectable place.</li>
