              <p className="mb-4">
              Asaan Qarz Loan was created in 2024 to help regular Pakistanis who are having trouble with their money. The company's founder, Dr. Amjad Shah, saw that the standard lending system had problems, such as complicated application processes, high interest rates, and strict requirements that kept many people from getting loans. To make up for this, he came up with a way for everyone to get cheap credit.
              </p>
              
              <p className="mb-4">
              The idea behind the effort was to make things easy, fair, and open to everyone. It offered low-interest loans, quick approvals, and a simple process. Asaan Qarz has always been about giving people from all walks of life more power. This method quickly gained trust across Pakistan and helped thousands of people get their finances in order and take charge of their lives.
